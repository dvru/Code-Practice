Linked List is a data structure consisting of a group of vertices (nodes) which together represent a sequence. 
Under the simplest form, each vertex is composed of a data and a reference (link) to the next vertex in the sequence

Linked List and its variations are used as underlying data structure to implement List, Stack, Queue, and Deque ADTs 
(read this Wikipedia article about ADT if you are not familiar with that term).
