///////What are Algorithms?
     Steps in a process we take to perform a desired action with computers

Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs
Class {} + function() = Programs

Types of Algorithms:
                    Sorting
                        Dynamic Programming
                            Searching + BFS + DFS
                                Recursion


/////Recursion:
Every Recursive function needs to have a base case/stop point
    
1. Identify the base case
2. Identify the Recursive case
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed.
    usuaally 2 return for base case and Recursive case

~~~Anything you do with a Recursion CAN be done iteratively (loop)


/////// NEW RULE!

Everytime you are using a tree or converting something into a tree, 
consider recursion:
1. Divided into a number of subproblem that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature.
3. The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand.
