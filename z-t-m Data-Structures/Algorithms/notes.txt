What are Algorithms?
     Steps in a process we take to perform a desired action with computers

Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs
Class {} + function() = Programs

Types of Algorithms:
                    Sorting
                        Dynamic Programming
                            Searching + BFS + DFS
                                Recursion

Recursion:
Every Recursive function needs to have a base case/stop point
