- What & why of Algorithm Run Time Analysis 
What?
-- It is the study of any given Algorithm's running time, by identifying its behavior as the inpur size for the Algorithm increases. 
    In layman's language we can say "how much time will the given algorithms will take to run"
Why?
-- To measure efficiency of a given algorithm
-- If we dont learn this topic, our program will look runned down.

- Types of Time Complexity 

- What are Notations
--There are 3 Notations for Run Time Analysis:
    Omega:
    This Notation gives the tighter lower bound of a given algorithm
